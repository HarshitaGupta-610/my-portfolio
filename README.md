A practice repo created to learn, experiment, and build backend skills for my portfolio website.
This repository contains all the experiments, modules, and backend components I built while learning how to power my portfolio website using real server-side logic. It includes hands-on practice with APIs, routing, authentication basics, data handling, and deployment workflows.
